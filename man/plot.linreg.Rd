\title{Plot Diagnostics for a Linear Model Fit}
\usage{
\method{plot}{linreg}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `linreg`, usually the result of a call to `linreg()`.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods (ignored).}
}
\value{
The original `linreg` object (returned invisibly). The function's primary
purpose is its side effect: generating and printing the plots.
}
\description{
Generates two standard diagnostic plots for an object of class "linreg"
using the `ggplot2` framework and arranges them in a single column using `patchwork`.
}
\details{
This function produces two plots to help assess the validity of the linear model assumptions:
\enumerate{
  \item **Residuals vs. Fitted**: Plots the model residuals against the fitted (predicted) values. This is used to detect non-linear patterns in the residuals.
  \item **Scale-Location**: Plots the square root of the absolute value of the standardized residuals against the fitted values. This is used to check for non-constant error variance (heteroscedasticity).
}
Both plots include a standard LOESS smoother (red line) and a robust, median-based quantile regression smoother (purple line) as suggested in the lab assignment. The top 3 most extreme data points are labeled with their row IDs.

\examples{
library(quantreg)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
model <- linreg(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, data = iris)
plot(model)
